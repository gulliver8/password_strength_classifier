Description:
This project involves training a logistic regression model on a provided dataset, 
with a focus on extracting and selecting the most relevant features. 
The process includes investigating feature correlations and testing various feature 
sets to identify the best performing ones. The model is evaluated using multiple methods, 
including computing accuracy on the test dataset, creating a confusion matrix, 
and generating an ROC curve.
